## Introduction

During 2024 and 2025, I designed, created and launched a rocket for the [American Rocketry Challenge](https://rocketrychallenge.org/). The challenge was to create a rocket that could carry two eggs up to an altitude of 790ft and land within a certain amount of time.

## Design

For my rocket, I decided to 3D print almost all of the parts because of the flexibility it allowed, and since the rockets were relatively small strength isn't as large of an issue. The goal of the competition is to score the least number of points, and you do that when the rocket has an apogee as close to the target altitude as possible. The way that most team achieve this is by running simulations and launching their rokets dozens of times in different conditions to determing how it will fly. This data can then be used to determine how much weight should be added to the rocket for it to reach the correct altitude.

There are a few problems with this approach though. To have a very succesful rocket you need to launch it many times which takes a long time. Also, if something goes wrong with the flight whether that is more wind than you thought or an underperforming motor your rocket will not fly how you want it to. To attempt to fix these problems, I decided that I was going to try and make an actively controlled rocket with airbrakes to slow it down if it is going to fast. The idea is to launch the rocket with a motor that will take it above the target altitude, and then use flaps to slow it down ensuring it reaches the correct height.

## Airbrakes

The airbrakes are the part of the rocket that can control the amount of drag that the rocket has slowing it down. I went through many iterations and designs of these until landing on something I was happy with.

If you want to read about the process, I detail it in this article:
